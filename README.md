# Move To Next Screen
GNOME extension that adds a shortcut (CTRL + SHIFT + PAGEUP) to move the active window to the next screen. Currently the shortcut can be adjusted by editing the setting using dconf. If anybody but me ends up using it, I may be inclined to add a small configuration interface to change it.
