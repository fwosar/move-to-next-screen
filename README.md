# Move To Next Screen
GNOME extension that adds a shortcut (<CTRL><SHIFT><Page Up>) to move the active window to the next screen. Currently the short cut can be adjusted by editing the setting using dconf. If anybody but me ends up using it, I may be inclined to add a small configuration interface to change it.
